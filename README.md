# topic-modeling
Developed a GitHub repository featuring a topic modeling project utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Gensim library to analyze over 200,000 news articles from various publishers such as New York Times, Breitbart, CNN, and Fox News. The repository contains code and resources necessary to run the analysis, including the preprocessed dataset and the final topic models.

Implemented LDA to discover underlying topics in the dataset by identifying the most relevant words and documents related to each topic. Generated topic-word and document-topic distributions to gain insights into the patterns and trends of the data. Utilized PyLDAvis, a data visualization library, to create interactive plots that allow the exploration of topic relationships and the most relevant words associated with each topic.

This project demonstrates expertise in topic modeling, data analysis, and data visualization techniques. The GitHub repository serves as a valuable resource for researchers, data enthusiasts, and anyone interested in exploring text data. The code and resources provided are useful for further analysis or adaptation for other similar projects.
